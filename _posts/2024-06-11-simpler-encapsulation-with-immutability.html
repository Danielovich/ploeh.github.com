        I've noticed that many software organizations struggle with <a href="/encapsulation-and-solid">encapsulation</a> with 'bigger' problems. It may be understandable and easily applicable to <a href="/2022/08/22/can-types-replace-validation">define a NaturalNumber type</a> or ensure that a minimum value is less than a maximum value, and so on. How do you, however, guarantee invariants once the scope of the problem becomes bigger and more complex?
    </p>
    <p>
        In this series of articles, I'll attempt to illustrate how this worthy design goal seems to elusive, and what you can do to achieve it.

        As usual, when I discuss <em>encapsulation</em>, I first need to establish what I mean by the term. It is, after all, one of the most misunderstood concepts in software development. As regular readers will know, I follow the lead of <a href="/ref/oosc">Object-Oriented Software Construction</a>. In that perspective, encapsulation is the appropriate modelling and application of <em>preconditions</em>, <em>invariants</em>, and <em>postconditions</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Particularly when it comes to invariants, things seem to fall apart as the problem being modelled grows in complexity. Teams eventually give up guaranteeing any invariants, leaving client developers with no recourse but <a href="/2013/07/08/defensive-coding">defensive coding</a>, which again leads to code duplication, bugs, and maintenance problems.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you need a reminder, an <em>invariant</em> is assertion about an object that is always true; or, at least, <em>ought</em> to be always true. The more invariants an object has, the better guarantees it gives, and the more you can trust it. The more you can trust it, the less defensive coding you have to write. You don't have to check if return values are null, strings empty, numbers negative, collections empty, or so on.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
        All together, I usually denote the collection of invariants, pre-, and postconditions as a type's <em>contract</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        For a simple example like modelling a natural number, or <a href="/2024/01/01/variations-of-the-range-kata">a range</a>, or a user name, most people are able to produce sensible and coherent designs. Once, however, the problem becomes more complex, and the invariants involve multiple interacting values, maintaining the contract becomes harder.

        Immutability to the rescue <a href="#8d70ef6ac6054c87b920c972cf26b3a5">#</a>

    <p>
        I'm not going to be burying the lede any longer. It strikes me that mutation is a major source of complexity. It's not that hard to check a set of conditions when you create a value (or object or record). What makes it hard to maintain invariants is when objects are allowed to change. This implies that for every possible change to the object, it needs to examine its current state in order to decide whether or not it should allow the operation.
    </p>
    <p>
        If the mutation happens on a leaf node in an object graph, the leaf may have to notify its parent, so that the parent can recheck the invariants. If the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph">graph</a> has cycles it becomes more complicated still, and if you want to make the problem truly formidable, try to make the object thread-safe.
    </p>
    <p>
        Making the object immutable makes most of these problems go away. You don't have to worry about thread-safety, because immutable values are automatically thread-safe; there's no state for any thread to change.
    </p>
    <p>
        Even better, though, is that an immutable object's contract is smaller and simpler. It still has preconditions, because there are rules that govern what has to be true before you can create such an object. Furthermore, there may also be rules that stipulate what must be true before you can call a method on it.
    </p>
    <p>
        Likewise, postconditions are still relevant. If you call a method on the object, it may give you guarantees about what it returns.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are, however, no independent invariants.
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="/content/binary/contract-pre-post.png" alt="The two sets of preconditions and postconditions, embedded in their common superset labeled contract.">
    </p>
    <p>
        Or rather, the invariants for an immutable object entirely coincide with its preconditions. If it was valid at creation, it remains valid.

    <p>
        As promised, I'll work through a problem to demonstrate what I mean. I'll first showcase how mutation makes the problem hard, and then how trivial it becomes with an immutable design.
    </p>
    <p>
        The problem is this: Design and implement a class (or just <em>data structure</em> if you don't want to do Object-Oriented programming) that models a priority list (not a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_queue">Priority Queue</a>) as you sometimes run into in surveys. You know, one of these survey questions that asks you to distribute 100 points on various different options:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Option F: 30%</li>
        <li>Option A: 25%</li>
        <li>Option C: 25%</li>
        <li>Option E: 20%</li>
        <li>Option B: 0%</li>
        <li>Option D: 0%</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        If you have the time, I suggest that you <a href="/2020/01/13/on-doing-katas">treat this problem as a kata</a>. Try to do the exercise before reading the next articles in this series. You can assume the following, which is what I did.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The budget is 100. (You could make it configurable, but the problem is gnarly enough even with a hard-coded value.)</li>
        <li>You don't need to include items with priority value 0, but you should allow it.</li>
        <li>The sum of priorities must be exactly 100. This is the invariant.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The difficult part is that last invariant. Let me stress this requirement: At any time, the object should be in a consistent state; i.e. at any time should the sum of priorities be exactly 100. Not 101 or 99, but 100. Good luck with that.
    </p>
    <p>
        The object should also be valid at initialization.
    </p>
    <p>
        Of course, having read this far, you understand that all you have to do is to make the object immutable, but just for the sake of argument, try designing a mutable object with this invariant. Once you've tried your had with that, read on.
    </p>

    <p>
        There's educational value going through even failed attempts. When I thought of this example, I fairly quickly outlined in my head one approach that was unlikely to ever work, one that could work, and the nice immutable solution that trivially works.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'll cover each in turn:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>A failed attempt at priority collection with inheritance</li>
        <li>A mutable priority collection</li>
        <li>An immutable priority collection</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        It's surprising how hard even a simple exercise like this one turns out to be if you try to do it the object-oriented way.
    </p>
    <p>
        In reality, business rules are much more involved than what's on display here. For only a taste of how bad it might get, read <a href="https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/archive/making-illegal-states-unrepresentable/">Hillel Wayne's suggestions regarding a similar kind of problem</a>.

    <p>
        If you've lived all your programming life with mutation as an ever-present possibility, you may not realize how much easier immutability makes everything. This includes invariants.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you have immutable data, object graphs tend to be simpler. You can't easily define cyclic graphs (although <a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a>, due to its laziness, surprisingly does enable this), and invariants essentially coincide with preconditions.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the following articles, I'll show how mutability makes even simple invariants difficult to implement, and how immutability easily addresses the issue.
