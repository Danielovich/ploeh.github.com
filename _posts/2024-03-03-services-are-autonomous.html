        This article is part of a series titled <a href="">The four tenets of SOA revisited</a>. In each of these articles, I'll pull one of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Box">Don Box</a>'s <em>four tenets of service-oriented architecture</em> (SOA) out of the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/msdn-magazine/2004/january/a-guide-to-developing-and-running-connected-systems-with-indigo">original MSDN Magazine article</a> and add some of my own commentary. If you're curious why I do that, I cover that in the introductory article.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this article, I'll go over the second tenet, quoting from the MSDN Magazine article unless otherwise indicated.

    <p>
        Compared with <a href="">the first tenet</a>, you'll see that Don Box had more to way about this one. I, conversely, have less to add. First, here's what the article said:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            Service-orientation mirrors the real world in that it does not assume the presence of an omniscient or omnipotent oracle that has awareness and control over all parts of a running system. This notion of service autonomy appears in several facets of development, the most obvious place being the area of deployment and versioning.
        </p>
        <p>
            Object-oriented programs tend to be deployed as a unit. Despite the Herculean efforts made in the 1990s to enable classes to be independently deployed, the discipline required to enable object-oriented interaction with a component proved to be impractical for most development organizations. When coupled with the complexities of versioning object-oriented interfaces, many organizations have become extremely conservative in how they roll out object-oriented code. The popularity of the XCOPY deployment and private assemblies capabilities of the .NET Framework is indicative of this trend.
        </p>
        <p>
            Service-oriented development departs from object-orientation by assuming that atomic deployment of an application is the exception, not the rule. While individual services are almost always deployed atomically, the aggregate deployment state of the overall system/application rarely stands still. It is common for an individual service to be deployed long before any consuming applications are even developed, let alone deployed into the wild. Amazon.com is one example of this build-it-and-they-will-come philosophy. There was no way the developers at Amazon could have known the multitude of ways their service would be used to build interesting and novel applications.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is common for the topology of a service-oriented application to evolve over time, sometimes without direct intervention from an administrator or developer. The degree to which new services may be introduced into a service-oriented system depends on both the complexity of the service interaction and the ubiquity of services that interact in a common way. Service-orientation encourages a model that increases ubiquity by reducing the complexity of service interactions. As service-specific assumptions leak into the public facade of a service, fewer services can reasonably mimic that facade and stand in as a reasonable substitute.
        </p>
        <p>
            The notion of autonomous services also impacts the way failures are handled. Objects are deployed to run in the same execution context as the consuming application. Service-oriented designs assume that this situation is the exception, not the rule. For that reason, services expect that the consuming application can fail without notice and often without any notification. To maintain system integrity, service-oriented designs use a variety of techniques to deal with partial failure modes. Techniques such as transactions, durable queues, and redundant deployment and failover are quite common in a service-oriented system.
        </p>
        <p>
            Because many services are deployed to function over public networks (such as the Internet), service-oriented development assumes not only that incoming message data may be malformed but also that it may have been transmitted for malicious purposes. Service-oriented architectures protect themselves by placing the burden of proof on all message senders by requiring applications to prove that all required rights and privileges have been granted. Consistent with the notion of service autonomy, service-oriented architectures invariably rely on administratively managed trust relationships in order to avoid per-service authentication mechanisms common in classic Web applications.
        </p>

    <p>
        Again, I'd like to highlight how general these ideas are. Once lifted out of the context of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Communication_Foundation">Windows Communication Foundation</a>, all of this applies more broadly.
    </p>
    <p>
        Perhaps a few details now seem dated, but in general I find that this description holds up well.

        It's striking that someone in 2004 observed that big, complex, coordinated releases are impractical. Even so, it doesn't seem as though adopting a network-based technology and architecture in itself solves that problem. <a href="/2012/12/18/ZookeepersmustbecomeRangers">I wrote about that in 2012</a>, and I've seen <a href="https://youtu.be/jdliXz70NtM?si=NRSHFqaVHMvWnOPF">Adam Ralph make a similar observation</a>. Many organizations inadvertently create distributed monoliths. I think that this often stems from a failure of heeding the tenet that services are autonomous.
    </p>
    <p>
        I've experienced the following more than once. A team of developers rely on a service. As they take on a new feature, they realize that the way things are currently modelled prevents them from moving forward. Typical examples include mismatched cardinalities. For example, a customer record has a single active address, but the new feature requires that customers may have multiple active addresses. It could be that a customer has a permanent address, but also a summerhouse.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is, however, the other service that defines how customer addresses are modelled, so the development team contacts the service team to discuss a breaking change. The service team agrees to the breaking change, but this means that the service and the relying client team now have to coordinate when they deploy the new versions of their software. The service is no longer autonomous.
    </p>
    <p>
        I've already discussed this kind of problem in <a href="/2023/11/27/synchronizing-concurrent-teams">a previous article</a>, and as Don Box also implied, this discussion is related to the question of versioning, which we'll get back to when covering the fourth tenet.
    </p>

    <p>
        It may be worthwhile to comment on this sentence:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>

        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Indeed, but particularly regarding database transactions, a service may use them <em>internally</em> (typically leveraging a database engine like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_SQL_Server">SQL Server</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Database">Oracle</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostgreSQL">PostgreSQL</a>, etc.), but not across services. Around the time Don Box wrote the original MSDN Magazine article an extension to SOAP colloquially known as <em>WS-Death Star</em> was in the works, and it included <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WS-Transaction">WS Transaction</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        I don't know whether Don Box had something like this in mind when he wrote the word <em>transaction</em>, but in my experience, you don't want to go there. If you need to, you can make use of database transactions to keep your own service <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID">ACID</a>-consistent, but don't presume that this is possible with multiple autonomous services.
    </p>
    <p>
        As always, even if a catchphrase such as <em>services are autonomous</em> sounds good, it's always illuminating to understand that there are trade-offs involved - and what they are. Here, a major trade-off is that you need to think about error-handling in a different way. If you don't already know how to address such concerns, look up <em>lock-free transactions</em> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventual_consistency">eventual consistency</a>. As Don Box also mentioned, durable queues are often part of such a solution, as is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence">Idempotence</a>.

    <p>
        From this discussion follows that an autonomous service should, ideally, exist independently of the software ecosystem in which it exists. While an individual service can't impose its will on its surroundings, it can, and should, behave in a consistent and correct manner.
    </p>
    <p>
        This does include deliberate consistency for the service itself. An autonomous service may make use of ACID or eventual consistency as the service owner deems appropriate.
    </p>
    <p>
        It should also treat all input as suspect, until proven otherwise. Input validation is an important part of service design. It is my belief that <a href="/2020/12/14/validation-a-solved-problem">validation is a solved problem</a>, but that doesn't mean that you don't have to put in the work. You should consider correctness, versioning, as well as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle">Postel's law</a>.

    <p>
        The second of Don Box's four tenets of SOA state that services should be autonomous. At first glance, you may think that all this means is that a service shouldn't share its database with another service. That is, however, a minimum bar. You need to consider how a service exists in an environment that it doesn't control. Again, the <a href="/2012/12/18/RangersandZookeepers">wildlife metaphor</a> seems apt. Particularly if your service is exposed to the internet, it lives in a hostile environment.
    </p>
    <p>
        Not only should you consider all input belligerent, you must also take into account that friendly systems may disappear or change. Your service exists by itself, supported by itself, relying on itself. If you need to coordinate work with other service owners, that's a strong hint that your service isn't, after all, autonomous.
